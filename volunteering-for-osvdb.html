<h1>Volunteering for OSVDB</h1>
<div>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 24 Jun 2006</div>
<p>
  I am now an active Open Source Vulnerability Database (OSVDB)
  volunteer. I joined it on 06 Jun 2006. Although I enrolled as a
  volunteer there around 3 weeks, I worked on a vulnerability for the
  first time today. The vulnerability I picked for my first
  contribution
  was <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2006-2971">0verkill
  recv_packet() Function UDP Handling Overflow DoS</a>. This is an
  integer underflow error in a Linux based gaming daemon called
  0verkill. It could be exploited to launch DoS attacks by sending UDP
  packets of size less than 12 bytes to the 0verkill daemon. An
  example exploit code is available
  at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20201208191904/https://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/436659/100/0/threaded">this
  Bugtraq thread</a>.

  OSVDB is a project of the Open Security Foundation. Its goal is to
  provide accurate, unbiased information about security
  vulnerabilities in computerized equipment. The core of OSVDB is a
  relational database which ties various information about security
  vulnerabilities into a common, cross-referenced data source.
</p>
<p>
  In OSVDB, vulnerability reports, advisories, and exploits posted in
  various security lists enter the database as new entries. Each new
  entry contains only a title and links to entries of the same
  vulnerability in other security lists. However, a new entry does not
  contain any detailed description of the vulnerability. After the new
  entries are thoroughly scrutinized, analyzed, and refined by us, we
  add vulnerability description, technical description, solution
  description, manual testing notes, etc. Then these details on each
  entry are reviewed by other members of OSVDB, further refined if
  necessary, and then marked as stable entries. Once an entry for a
  vulnerability becomes stable, the detailed information for it
  appears on the page for the entry. One of the wonderful things that
  OSVDB brings to the world of security research is that each entry
  published on the OSVDB website has an extensive and almost
  exhaustive list of cross-references linking together all information
  about the vulnerability available on various security databases.
