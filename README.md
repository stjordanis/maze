Susam's Maze
============

[Maze](https://susam.in/maze/) is my first personal website and blog.
It was originally an intranet portal that I used to run for my fellow
students during my engineering study days back in 2001-2005. The
server used to host an FTP server and an HTTP portal for mathematics
puzzles, free software downloads, and audio/video streaming.

The original intranet portal and its source code written in Classic
ASP are now long gone. However, some of its content still survives on
this website. This website was rewritten from scratch a couple of
years after I completed my engineering studies. This is now a static
website generated using a Common Lisp program. Just like the original
website, every line of HTML and CSS that appears in the website is
handcrafted.

The primary copy of this website is now published at
[susam.in/maze/](https://susam.in/maze/). A mirror is published at
[susam.github.io/maze/](https://susam.github.io/maze/).
