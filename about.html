  <h1>About Susam's Maze</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to my maze of musings! This is my space on the web to
    write and share my notes, puzzles, thoughts, and experiments.
  </p>

  <h2 id="maze">Maze of Musings<a href="#maze"></a></h2>
  <p>
    This website is an accompaniment to my primary blog hosted
    at <a href="https://susam.in/blog/">susam.in/blog/</a>. My primary
    blog is also mirrored
    at <a href="https://susam.github.io/blog/">susam.github.io/blog/</a>.
    The posts on my primary blog tend to be long-form, involved, and
    detailed. They sometimes take considerable time to write and
    publish. As a result, I don't update my primary blog very often.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is my secondary blog hosted
    at <a href="https://susam.in/maze/">susam.in/maze/</a> and
    mirrored
    at <a href="https://susam.github.io/maze/">susam.github.io/maze/</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This secondary blog is supposed to be a relaxed place where I can
    write often without worrying too much about polishing each post.
    This is a place where I take technical notes, quickly share
    anything interesting I come across, jot down my thoughts, and so
    on. Due to the casual nature of this secondary blog, the posts
    here are going to be less thorough than the ones in my primary
    blog. This allows me to update this blog more often.
  </p>
  <p>
    The name <em>maze</em> refers to the first toy, a ball-in-a-maze
    puzzle, I had received as a four-year-old kid.

  <h2 id="history">History<a href="#history"></a></h2>
  <p>
    This website is a descendant of an intranet server
    named <code>maze</code> that I used to run for my fellow students
    during my engineering study days back in 2001-2005. The server
    used to host an FTP server and an HTTP portal for mathematics
    puzzles, free software downloads, and audio/video streaming. While
    that intranet portal and its source code written in Classic ASP
    are now long gone, some of its content still survives on this
    website.

    The information box below shows which color theme is selected
    right now.
  </p>
  <p class="light highlight">
    This website is currently displayed with <strong>light color
      theme</strong>. Note that this is the default color scheme when your
    web browser does not indicate what color theme it prefers.
  </p>
  <p class="dark highlight">
    This website is currently displayed with <strong>dark color

    theme, please check if your operating system or web browser supports

    support it.
