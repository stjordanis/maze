<h1>Polar Bear Puzzle</h1>
<div>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 09 Mar 2011</div>
<p>
  Alice asked Bob, "A bear walked 1 km south, then 1 km west, then 1
  km north, and it was back at the point from where it started. What
  colour was the bear most likely to be?"
</p>
<p>
  Bob thought for a while, could not arrive at an answer, and gave up.
  Alice explained, "Well, the answer is white. It is a polar bear. It
  is only when you start from the North Pole that after travelling 1
  km south, 1 km west, and 1 km north you would end up at the point
  where you started."
</p>
<p>
  Bob replied, "That is an interesting solution. Now that I understand
  your solution, I realize that there are other starting points apart
  from the North Pole where one could walk 1 km south, then 1 km west,
  and then 1 km north to return to the starting point."
</p>
<p>
  Can you find all the other such starting points that Bob is talking
  about?
</p>
<p>
  See the comments page for the solution.
