<h1>Hacktoberfest Spam</h1>
<div>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 01 Oct 2020</div>
<p>
  I received two pull requests for two of my projects on GitHub today.
  I am the author of one and the maintainer of the other.
</p>
<p>
  At first, the pull requests did not make sense at all. One of them
  made minor changes to a README, e.g., changing "this book" to "the
  book". It did not fix a typo or grammatical error. It merely chose a
  word different from the one I had chosen. In fact, I preferred "this
  book", so the pull request (PR) was inconsistent with my preference.
  There was no explanation whatsoever regarding why this change was
  warranted. Then I looked at the pull request author's profile and
  found that the same person had submitted several such trivial pull
  requests to other projects too, all of them changing "this" to "the"
  at some places in various README files.
</p>
<p>
  It all began to make sense when I looked at the calendar. It was Oct
  01. This looked like pull request spam due to Hacktoberfest. For
  now, I just labelled the pull requests as "invalid" (as suggested by
  the <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/faq/">Hacktoberfest
  FAQ</a>), closed the pull requests, and moved on.
</p>
<p>
  Like all good things created with good intentions on the Internet,
  spam is hurting this event and bringing bad reputation to it. The
  possibility of large scale, endless spam should be worked into the
  design of any new Internet-based event or solution.
