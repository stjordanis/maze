<h1>Fork Bunny</h1>

<p>
  Have a close look at this line of shell command that can be executed
  on Bash, Zsh, and most POSIX or POSIX-like shells:
</p>
<pre><code>: () { : | : & } ; :</code></pre>
<p>
  Beware! Don't execute it on your system without understanding the
  consequences completely. If the command above looks puzzling, that
  is because it is deliberately obfuscated. Let us simplify it.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>:</code> is a function name. It could very well have
  been <code>f</code>. Let us replace <code>:</code>
  with <code>f</code> and see what the code now looks like.
</p>
<pre><code>f () { f | f & } ; f</code></pre>
<p>
Now it looks familiar. We have two commands separated by a semicolon.
Written in a more legible manner, the code would look like this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>f()
{
    f | f &
}

f</code>
</pre>
<p>
  It creates a function <code>f</code> and then executes it. This
  function calls itself twice recursively. The control
  operator <code>&</code> executes the recursive calls
  to <code>f</code> asynchronously, i.e., in the background. The
  number of instances of the function executing keeps growing
  exponentially thereby depleting CPU cycles and memory. The system is
  rendered unusable soon.
</p>
<p>
  This type of denial-of-service attack by self-replication is also
  known as a <em>fork bunny</em> which is a specific type
  of <em>wabbit</em>. See the following entry in the Jargon File for
  more information on
  this: <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/W/wabbit.html">wabbit</a>.
