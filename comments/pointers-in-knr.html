  K&amp;R is easily one of the best CS/programming books. Short,
  concise and to the point.
</p>
<p>
  Another way to learn pointers is via assembly. Either learn assembly
  or just look at the disassembled code. Look under the hood and it'll
  become clearer.
</p>
<p>
  Of course the best way is to write your own C compiler but that may
  be overkill for most.

  Rather more surprising, at first sight, is the fact that a reference
  to <code>a[i]</code> can also be written as <code>*(a+i)</code>.

<p>
  I did not find that all that surprising, but the first time I saw
  that <code>a[i]</code> can also be written as <code>i[a]</code>, I
  was very irritated.

  I don't know. I read the pointers chapter at least 3 times, and I
  still get confused when I see pointer stuff in real code. The other
  day, I read
  the <a href="https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html">famous
  regex post by Russ Cox</a>, and it took me a couple of hours to
  understand the pointer parts of the code even though the algorithm
  behind it was relatively simple. I guess pointers are just one of
  those things that for some people make a lot of sense, whereas
  others struggle with.
