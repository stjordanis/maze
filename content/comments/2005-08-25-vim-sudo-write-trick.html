  The quotes around the percent sign are unnecessary. The
    command <code>:w ! sudo tee %</code> works just fine. I use it
    everytime!

  LP,
</p>
<p>
  Like I explained in my blog post, the quotes around the percent sign
  are necessary to keep the filename as a single argument when the
  filename contains whitespace. If there is no whitespace in the
  filename, then the quotes are not necessary.
</p>
<p>
  Here is an experiment that demonstrates the purpose of quotes:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Enter the following command to create a filename with a space in
      it and then open it with Vim:
    </p>
    <pre><code>sudo touch "foo bar.txt"
vim "foo bar.txt"</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In Vim, insert some text with the following key sequence:
      <kbd>i</kbd> <kbd>hello</kbd> <kbd>&lt;esc&gt;</kbd>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now enter the following command in Vim to save the file:
    </p>
    <pre><code>:w !sudo tee %</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In another instance of the terminal, enter the following command
      to check the content of the file:
    </p>
    <pre><code>cat "foo bar.txt"</code></pre>
    <p>
      The file still appears empty. Nothing was saved to this file.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now enter the following commands:
    </p>
    <pre><code>cat foo
cat bar.txt</code></pre>
    <p>
      Both files contain the text <code>hello</code> in them.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  This experiment shows that due to the lack of quotes
  around <code>%</code>, the command <code>tee %</code> expands
  to <code>tee foo bar.txt</code> which ends up writing the content of
  the buffer to both files <code>foo</code> and <code>bar.txt</code>
  but not to <code>foo bar.txt</code> as we desire.
</p>
<p>
  This is why we need to write <code>tee "%"</code> so that it expands
  to <code>tee "foo bar.txt"</code> and the content of the buffer is
  written to the file named <code>foo bar.txt</code>.
</p>
