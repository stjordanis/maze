<title>Euler's Formula</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>
  I know that Euler's identity is widely regarded as the most beautiful
  theorem in mathematics. In my opinion, the truly beautiful concept
  involved here is Euler's formula:

  \[
  e^{ix} = \cos x + i \sin x.
  \]

  It unifies algebra, trigonometry, complex numbers, and calculus.
  Euler's identity is only a special case of Euler's formula, i.e.,
  Euler's formula with \( x = \pi \) gives us Euler's identity:

  \[
  e^{i \pi} = -1.
  \]

  This is cute but Euler's formula is truly beautiful. In fact with \( x
  = \tau = 2\pi, \) we get another cute result:

  \[
  e^{i \tau} = 1.
  \]

  Quoting an excerpt from Chapter 22 of <em>The Feynman Lectures on
  Physics, Volume I</em>:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    We summarize with this, the most remarkable formula in mathematics:

    \[
    e^{i \theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta.
    \]

    This is our jewel.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may relate the geometry to the algebra by representing complex
    numbers in a plane; the horizontal position of a point is \( x, \)
    the vertical position of a point is \( y. \) We represent every
    complex number, \( x + iy. \) Then if the radial distance to this
    point is called \( r \) and the angle is called \( \theta, \) the
    algebraic law is that \( x + iy \) is written in the form \( r,
    e^{i \theta} \) where the geometrical relationships between \( x
    \) \( y, \) \( r, \) and \( \theta \) are as shown. This, then,
    is the unification of algebra and geometry.
  </p>

<p>
  An island contained chameleons of three different colours: red,
  green and blue. The chameleons were studied by some biologists and
  they found that when two chameleons of different colours met they
  changed their colours to the third one. They found that there were
  2000 red chameleons and 3000 green ones on the day they counted
  them. They didn't get time to count the number of blue chameleons.
</p>
<p>
  When the biologists returned to the island two months later they
  found that all chameleons were red in colour. They were certain that
  no chameleons died because they did not find dead remains of any
  chameleon. What does it say about the number of blue chameleons on
  the day the biologists counted the number of red and green
  chameleons?

<title>Calendar Cubes Puzzle</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[
<p>
  How many different ways are there to assign the ten digits of Arabic
  numerals (0 to 9) to each face of two cubes to ensure that we can
  arrange both cubes on any day such that the front faces of the cubes
  show the current day of the month?
</p>
<p>
  For example, on February 9 the cubes would be placed side by side
  such that the front face of the cube on the left side shows 0 and
  that of the one on the right side shows 9.
</p>
<p>
  Two ways of assigning the digits to the faces of the cubes are
  considered different if and only if it is not possible to get one
  assignment from the other by performing one or more of the following
  operrations:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Rotating (reorienting) the digits with respect to the faces they
    belong to.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rotating the cubes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Swapping the cubes.
  </li>
</ol>

<title>Polar Bear Puzzle</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[
<p>
  Alice asked Bob, "A bear walked 1 km south, then 1 km west, then 1
  km north, and it was back at the point from where it started. What
  colour was the bear most likely to be?"
</p>
<p>
  Bob thought for a while, could not arrive at an answer, and gave up.
  Alice explained, "Well, the answer is white. It is a polar bear. It
  is only when you start from the North Pole that after travelling 1
  km south, 1 km west, and 1 km north you would end up at the point
  where you started."
</p>
<p>
  Bob replied, "That is an interesting solution. Now that I understand
  your solution, I realize that there are other starting points apart
  from the North Pole where one could walk 1 km south, then 1 km west,
  and then 1 km north to return to the starting point."
</p>
<p>
  Can you find all the other such starting points that Bob is talking
  about?
</p>

<title>Squaring Numbers That Begin or End With 5</title>
<link>https://susam.in/maze/squaring-numbers-that-begin-or-end-with-5.html</link>
<guid>https://susam.in/maze/squaring-numbers-that-begin-or-end-with-5.html</guid>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<p>
  In this post, I will discuss some simple tricks I use to square
  numbers that begin or end with the digit \( 5 \). We will first see
  a few illustrations of each trick. Then we will generalize the
  tricks for any number that begins or ends with the digit \( 5 \).
</p>

<h2 id="squaring-a-2-digit-number-that-ends-with-5">Squaring a 2-Digit Number That Ends With 5<a href="#squaring-a-2-digit-number-that-ends-with-5"></a></h2>
<p>
  I learnt this from an arithmetic book during my childhood days. If
  the first digit of a 2-digit number is \( a \) and the second digit
  is \( 5 \) in decimal representation, then its square can then be
  written as the result of \( a \times (a + 1) \) followed by \( 25 \)
  in decimal representation, i.e., the first few digits of the square
  is given by \( a \times (a + 1) \) and the last two digits are \( 25
  \). Here are some examples:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>\( 25^2 = 625. \) (Note that \( 2 \times 3 = 6. \))</li>
  <li>\( 85^2 = 7225. \) (Note that \( 8 \times 9 = 72. \))</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="squaring-a-2-digit-number-that-begins-with-5">Squaring a 2-Digit Number That Begins With 5<a href="#squaring-a-2-digit-number-that-begins-with-5"></a></h2>
<p>
  After learning the previous trick, I wondered if I could make more
  such tricks for myself. This is the first one I could come up with.
  If the first digit of a 2-digit number is \( 5 \) and the second
  digit is \( a \), then its square can be written as the result of \(
  25 + a \) followed by \( a^2 \). In other words, the first two
  digits of the square are obtained from the result of \( 25 + a \)
  and the last two digits are obtained from the result of \( a^2 \).
  Here are some examples:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>\( 52^2 = 2704. \) (Note that \( 25 + 2 = 27 \) and \( 2^2 = 4. \))</li>
  <li>\( 57^2 = 3249. \) (Note that \( 25 + 7 = 32 \) and \( 7^2 = 49. \))</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="squaring-any-number-that-ends-with-5">Squaring Any Number That Ends with 5<a href="#squaring-any-number-that-ends-with-5"></a></h2>
<p>
  Let us represent all digits except the last one as \( a \), e.g., if
  we are given the number \( 115 \), we say, \( a = 11 \). Then we can
  express the given number algebraically as \( 10a + 5 \). Note that
  the square of this number is

  \[
  (10a + 5)^2 = 100a(a + 1) + 25.
  \]

  In decimal representation, this amounts to writing the result of \(
  a(a + 1) \) followed by \( 25. \) Here are some examples:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>\( 115^2 = 13225. \) (Note that \( 11 \times 12 = 132. \))</li>
  <li>\( 9995^2 = 99900025. \) (Note that \( 999 \times 1000 = 999000. \))</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="squaring-any-number-that-begins-with-5">Squaring Any Number That Begins With 5<a href="#squaring-any-number-that-begins-with-5"></a></h2>
<p>
  Let us represent all digits except the first one as \( a \), e.g.,
  if we are given the number \( 512 \), we say, \( a = 12 \). Then we
  can express the given number algebraically as \( 5 \times 10^n + a
  \) where \( n \) is the number of digits in \( a \). Note that

  \[
  (5 \times 10^n + a)^2 = 25 \times 10^{2n} + 10^{n + 1} a + a^2.
  \]

  In decimal reprensetation, this amounts to performing the following
  steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Write \( 25 \) as the first two digits.
  </li>
  <li>
    Then write \( a^2 \) as a \( 2n \)-digit number immediately after
    \( 25 \). Prefix \( a^2 \) with appropriate number of \( 0 \)s so
    that \( a^2 \) is written with \( 2n \) digits.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write the \( + \)-sign directly below the first digit, that is,
    write the \( + \)-sign directly before the first \( 2 \).
  </li>
  <li>
    Write every digit of \( a \) including any preceding \( 0 \)s
    immediately after the \( + \)-sign.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally add the numbers in both rows column by column performing
    the carrying operation whenever necessary.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Here are some examples:

  \[
  502^2 = \\
  \left\{ \begin{array}{cccccc}
  2 & 5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \\
  + & 0 & 2 \\
  \hline
  2 & 5 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 4
  \end{array} \right\} = 252004.
  \]

  \[
  512^2 = \\
  \left\{ \begin{array}{cccccc}
  2 & 5 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 4 \\
  + & 1 & 2 \\
  \hline
  2 & 6 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 4
  \end{array} \right\} = 262114.
  \]

  \[
  564^2 = \\
  \left\{ \begin{array}{cccccc}
  2 & 5 & 4 & 0 & 9 & 6 \\
  + & 6 & 4 \\
  \hline
  3 & 1 & 8 & 0 & 9 & 6 \\
  \end{array} \right\} = 318096.
  \]

</p>

<h2 id="applying-both-tricks-together">Applying Both Tricks Together<a href="#applying-both-tricks-together"></a></h2>
<p>
  Let us now see an example where we use both the tricks together. Let
  us find \( 5195^2 \). This is a number that begins with the digit \(
  5 \) as well as ends with the digit \( 5 \). We need to use the
  second trick to find \( 5195^2 \). But the second trick begins with
  writing \( 25 \) immediately followed by the result of \( 195^2 \),
  so we use the first trick to calculate \( 195^2 \).
</p>
<p>
  To write the result of \( 195^2 \), we first write \( 380 \) which
  we obtain as the result of \( 19 \times 20 \) and then we write \(
  25 \) immediately after it. Thus \( 195^2 = 38025 \). Now we
  perform the second trick as follows:

  \begin{align*}
  5195^2 =
  \left\{ \begin{array}{cccccccc}
  2 & 5 & 0 & 3 & 8 & 0 & 2 & 5 \\
  + & 1 & 9 & 5 \\
  \hline
  2 & 6 & 9 & 8 & 8 & 0 & 2 & 5
  \end{array} \right\} = 26988025.
  \end{align*}

  Today I learnt how to create an aggregate function in PostgreSQL
  function that wraps the functionality provided by other aggregate
  functions in PosgreSQL. In this experiment, I created
  a <code>cv()</code> function that calculates the coefficient of
  variation. The function <code>cv(x)</code> is equivalent
  to <code>stddev(x)</code> / <code>avg(x)</code> where <code>x</code>
  represents the list of data points.
