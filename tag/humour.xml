  The Open Source Vulnerability Database (OSVDB) is participating in
  Google Summer of Code (GSoC) this year. I have been contributing to
  OSVDB as a <em>vulnerability mangler</em> since Aug 2006 and
  analyzing new vulnerabilities being published by security
  researchers, adding more details to them depending on the nature and
  severity of the vulnerabilities, and cataloging them. Our internal
  systems for cataloging vulnerabilities could use some help from more
  contributors, so it is great that OSVDB is participating in GSoC
  this year.

<p>
  Last month we selected some potential contributors from a pile of
  applications. One of them is Timothy F. Tutt Jr. who will be doing
  the Researcher Confidence Project for OSVDB.

<p>
  In the commenting system for OSVDB contributors, Brian Martin a.k.a.
  Jericho, one of the project leaders, wrote this comment that I found
  quite funny:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Don't think I need to argue how big this is to me, given the time I
  spend arguing with researchers and vendors. If we approve this and I
  am not the mentor, I will feed Jake to a woodchipper.
</blockquote>
