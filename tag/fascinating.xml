  There is a wonderful story about a legendary Lisp debugging story in
  the second chapter of the book <em>Practical Common Lisp</em> by
  Peter Seibel. Quoting the story here:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    An even more impressive instance of remote debugging occurred on
    NASA's 1998 Deep Space 1 mission. A half year after the space
    craft launched, a bit of Lisp code was going to control the
    spacecraft for two days while conducting a sequence of
    experiments. Unfortunately, a subtle race condition in the code
    had escaped detection during ground testing and was already in
    space. When the bug manifested in the wild--100 million miles away
    from Earth--the team was able to diagnose and fix the running
    code, allowing the experiments to complete. One of the
    programmers described it as follows:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Debugging a program running on a $100M piece of hardware that is
      100 million miles away is an interesting experience. Having a
      read-eval-print loop running on the spacecraft proved invaluable
      in finding and fixing the problem.
