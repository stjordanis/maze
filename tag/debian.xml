  Did you know that Debian releases are named after characters from
  the <em>Toy</em> Story films? I began using it with Debian 4 (Etch)
  in 2007. It was named after Etch A Sketch, one of Andy's toys. The
  latest release, Debian 10 (Buster), is named after Andy's pet puppy.
</p>
<p>
  The name Debian itself is a portmanteau of the names Ian Murdock
  (the creator of Debian) and Debra Lynn (his then-girlfriend, later
  ex-wife). As a result, this name has been called a <em>curiously
  personal name for such a community-oriented project</em>.

  I was using Fedora and Ubuntu in 2007 when a member of a local Linux
  User Group (LUG) introduced me to Debian. Its simplicity and
  elegance, its vast package repository, and its stability and
  robustness made me an ardent user of this distribution pretty
  quickly. Thirteen years later, I still use Debian on my laptops,
  Linode servers, and virtual machines. I run
  my <a href="https://susam.in/">personal website</a> on Debian too. I
  have got so used to <code>apt-get install</code> and the large
  number of tools available in the Debian repositories that I keep a
  Debian virtual machine or a remote shell handy when I am working on
  a non-Debian system. Over these years, I have gradually moved from
  GNOME 2 to GNOME 3 and then to Xfce 4. It really helps that Debian
  still provides an installation CD with Xfce as the default. In case
  anyone is interested, I have documented and shared
  my <a href="https://github.com/susam/dotfiles/blob/master/docs/debian-setup.md">Debian
  setup notes on GitHub</a>.
