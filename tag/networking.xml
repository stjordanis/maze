  While computing certain round-trip times, here is a number I came
  across that is not easy to forget: It takes light 0.1337 seconds to
  travel once around the Earth's equator via vacuum or air. Let me
  repeat that. It takes light "zero point leet" seconds to travel once
  around the equator.
</p>
<p>
  The equatorial radius of the Earth is about 6378.137 km. The
  equatorial circumference of the Earth then is about 40075 km. The
  speed of light in vacuum is 299792.458 km/s by definition. The speed
  of light in air is about 299705 km/s. Therefore, it takes light
  about 40075/299792.458 seconds in vacuum and about 40075/299705
  seconds in air to travel once around the equator. Both values can be
  written as 0.1337 seconds accurate up to 4 decimal places.
